# recommend-it-draft

## Summary of App:
Have you ever used Goodreads and thought "hey this is pretty awesome, but I wish I could recommend things other than books" :( If so, then this is for you! RecommendIt is the perfect way to not only keep track of things you've done and want to do, but to see what you're friends are recommending as well! From books, shows, movies, articles, games, places, etc. - you name it, you can recommendIt.

## User Stories/MVP: 
1. Users can sign up with their first name, last name, username (unique), and password to join the RecommendIt social network.
2. Users can log in with their username and password. After logging in, users will be directed to their profile page.
3. Users can add a Tryit or Doneit on their profile page - DoneIts refer to things they've already done and want to rate/recommend, TryIts are things they haven't done yet but want to do. 
4. Users can search for friends and follow them to be able to see their recommendations. Following is public (no permission needed to follow - simply click follow). 
- Navigation bar will also have a search input where users can search for friends. On typing, their friends will show up in the search results. To view more (i.e. other users they aren't friends with) they can click "see more" and be guided to a new page with the search results matching that name. Search results will be based on whether or not search term matched first or last name of user, or username

8. Users can pin another user's TryIt or DoneIt to add it to their own list of TryIts
